# PyDice
Dice Throwing Simulation

This is a simple dice throwing simulation for Python in several versions:
  - pydice.py rolls a specified number of dice in the command line
  - tk_dice.py rolls a specified number of dice in a Tkinter widget
  - tk_dice_images.py rolls a single dice in a Tkinter widget with images of the dice
  - tk_multi_dice.py rolls any number of die between 1-12 with images of the dice
  - djdice runs a django version of PyDice, with one die
  - Roll the Dice contains a version of PyDice as an iPhone/iPad app
  
** Future version will update djdice to roll multiple dice.

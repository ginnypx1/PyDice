# PyDice
Dice Throwing Simulation

This is a simple dice throwing simulation for Python in three versions:
  - pydice.py rolls a specified number of dice in the command line
  - tk_dice.py rolls a specified number of dice in a Tkinter widget
  - tk_dice_images.py rolls a single dice in a Tkinter widget with images of the dice
  
** A later planned version will update tk_dice_images.py to roll a specified number of dice, in images
